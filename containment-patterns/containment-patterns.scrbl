DOCUMENT UNDER CONSTRUCTION

Containment-patterns implements several match-expanders which can be used anywhere
@racket[racket/match] pattern-matching is available. ‚ã± , ‚ã±+ , and ‚ã±1 descend
into s-expressions to capture arbitarily deep matches and their multi-holed contexts.

Insert a `‚ã±` in Dr. Racket by typing `\ddo` (diagonal dots) and then pressing `alt`+`\`

@section[#:tag "why"]{Why}

I implemented containment patterns to write concise updates on
nested structures for syntax-rewriting purposes in structured-editing
and algebraic-stepper prototypes. See @hyperlink["https://github.com/disconcision/fructure" "fructure"]
for an actual use case, or for something simpler,
@hyperlink["https://github.com/disconcision/racketlab/blob/master/choice-stepper.rkt"
           "this toy stepper"].

@subsection[#:tag "how"]{How}

An 'n-holed context' is a captured composable continuation which
can be called in a pattern template as a normal n-ary procedure. These continuations
are captured as the pattern-matcher left-to-right preorder-traverses the target
looking for matches. 



`‚ã±+` is similar, but it binds a list of all matches instead of just the first result

and `‚ã±1` insists that the match should be unique.

Caveat: If you're using any matchers which have side-effects, note that the inner pattern is evaluated twice for each successful match.

### ‚ã± Usage Examples

See the tests in main.rkt for more examples and additional *secret bonus features* (which may not yet have found their final forms):

1. Check if an item is contained in a nested list:

```racket
(check-true
  (match `(0 (0 1) 2 3)
    [(‚ã± 1) #t]))
```

2. Extracting data from a nested context:
```racket
(check-equal?
  (match `(0 (1 zap) 2 3)
    [(‚ã± `(1 ,a)) a])
  `zap)
```                

3. Making an update in a nested context:

```racket
(check-equal?
  (match '(0 0 (0 (0 0 (‚ñπ 1)) 0 0))
    [(‚ã± context `(‚ñπ ,a))
     (‚ã± context `(‚ñπ ,(add1 a))])
  '(0 0 (0 (0 0 (‚ñπ 2)) 0 0))
```

4. Serial substitutions:
(note how `‚ã±+` is optional in the template; a context is just a function)

```racket
(match '(0 1 (0 1 (1 0)) 0 1)
  [(‚ã±+ c 1)
   (c 3 4 5 6)])
```

5. Moving a cursor `‚ñπ` through a traversal in a nested list of `0`s and `1`s:

```racket
(check-equal?
  (match '(0 1 (0 1 (1 (‚ñπ 0))) 0 1)
    [(‚ã±+ c (and a (or `(‚ñπ ,_) (? number?))))
     (‚ã±+ c (match a [`(,x ... (‚ñπ ,y) ,z ,w ...)
                      `(,SPLICEx ,y (‚ñπ ,z) ,SPLICEw)]))])
  '(0 1 (0 1 (1 0)) (‚ñπ 0) 1))

@section[#:tag "patterns"]{Pattern Forms}


@defform*[((‚ã± <pattern>)
           (‚ã± <context-name> <pattern>))]{
Traverses a target s-expression left-to-right and depth-first
until a match to @racket[<pattern>] is found, then hands off control to <pattern>.
Optionally, the context surrounding the match is captured as a
unary procedure called <context-name> satisfying
(@scheme[equal?] (<context> the-match) orginal-sexpr).}

@defform[#:id ‚ã±1 (‚ã±1 <context-name> <pattern>)]{
Same as @racket[‚ã±] except it enforces that the match must be unique.}

@defform[#:id ‚ã±+ (‚ã±+ <context-name> <pattern>)]{
}
